# Onboarding-Buddy
Slack App Bot using AWS Lex and AWS Lambda, that can answer questions of new hires/ interns about the company.

So my inspiration for this bot was to basically help start ups with the onboarding process of interns/new hires. Usually startup employees are too busy to fully catch up new hires/interns. This way any questions that the newbies have can be asnwered by this slack bot.

## Current Implementation
Will look through a set of acronyms used by a "startup" and help the newbie learn them. 

### Future Implementation
Will read and understand the companies many slack channels -> Will begin to learn about the company through the conversations it reads and be able to answer questions intelligently for the newbies. Will also be able to generate Jira boards and upate the status of current board activities. Other future uses would include linking to Workday/BambooHR or whatever the HR service beign used in order to answer questions about who the "VP of Engineering is?"
